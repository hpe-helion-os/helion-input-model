<p>This cloud model requires the following networks:</p>
<p>IPMI/iLO network, connected to the deployer and the IPMI/iLO ports of all physical servers.</p>
<p>A pair of bonded NICs which are used used by the following networks:</p>
<ul>
  <li>EXTERNAL-API - This is the network that users will use to make requests to the cloud</li>
  <li>EXTERNAL-VM - This is the network that will be used to provide access to VMs (via floating IP addresses)</li>
  <li>MANAGEMENT - This is the network that will be used for all internal traffic between the cloud services and traffic between VMs on private networks within the cloud</li>
</ul>
