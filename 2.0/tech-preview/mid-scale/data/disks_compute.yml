  disk-models:
  - name: COMPUTE-DISKS
    # Disk model to be used for compute nodes
    # /dev/sda_root is used as a volume group for /, /var/log and /var/crash
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
    # /dev/sdb is used as a volume group for /var/lib (for VM storage)
    # Additional discs can be added to either volume group
