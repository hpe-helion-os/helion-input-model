  disk-models:
  - name: DBMQ-DISKS
    # This example creates the file systems needed for the Data base and
    # Rabbit MQ services. It is based on a two *  1TB drive for a DBMQ server
    # with 64 GB of memory. The first drive is used for the OS and the second drive
    # for Rabbit MA & MySQL

        physical-volumes:
        # /dev/sda_root is used as a Volume Group for /, /var/log, and /var/crash
        # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
        # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
        # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
          - /dev/sda_root

        logical-volumes:
          # The policy is not to consume 100% of the space of each volume group.
          # At least 5% should be left free for snapshots and to allow for some flexibility.
