    # Disk model to be used for VSA nodes
    # /dev/sda_root is used as a Volume Group for /, /var/log, and /var/crash
    # sda_root is a templated value to align with whatever partition is really used
    # This value is checked in os config and replaced by the partition actually used
    # on sda e.g. sda1 or sda5
